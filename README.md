<h1>About the NPO</h1>
Our NPO is The Bread Project, whose mission is to support low-income Bay Area residents with intensive skill-based training, job placement support, and 15 months of follow-up services. We have many low income people, including immigrants and folks with low-employable skills, in underserved communities in the Bay Area. The Bread Project aims to create an ecosystem for employers and job seekers from those communities by providing skill development trainings and connections to employers. We want these low-income group people to feel empowered in their lives, and make it so that they can enjoy the same societal benefits as others. They provides bakery bootcamp job training programs and collaborates with many employers in the same domain to connect their trainees with them. They strive to help these people with no job and no confidence to gain financial stability.

<h1>The Challenge</h1>
Currently TBP manually handles the back and forth communication between their graduates and community employers, which takes approximately 30-45 days to successfully match a candidate with a job. This requires a lot of unnecessary work and time that could better be used to carry out their main focus of training their students instead. 

<h1> The Solution </h1>
We've built a website to automate this candidate/employer matching process in order to allow TBP to focus their efforts other aspects of their organization. It is essentially a job search website, similar to LinkedIn, except our project caters specifically to the graduates of TBP and their contact employers. It is tailored to a very specific user, a user that might not be very technology proficient and need an interface that really allows them to navigate easily.

<h2> The Architecture </h2>

<h2> Description </h2>
Our solution is built for two users in mind: the candidate and the company. On the candidate side, the user is able to post profiles and resumes as well as view and apply to job positions. On the company side, the user is able to post job positions and browse possible candidates. The design of the website incorporates the same style and theme as the home website of TBP, and was crafted very closely with the NPO and needs of its users in mind.
